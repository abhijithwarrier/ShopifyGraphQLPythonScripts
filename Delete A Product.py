PYTHON SCRIPT TO DELETE A PRODUCT FROM Shopify AND TRY RETRIEVING IT USING GraphQL Admin API

This script demonstrates how to delete a product from Shopify using the GraphQL Admin API.

It first sends a mutation request to delete a specific product by its ID. After the deletion,
it attempts to retrieve the same product to verify its removal from the store.

If the product is successfully deleted, Shopify will return an error or null response when
trying to fetch it. This process ensures that the product no longer exists in the storeâ€™s catalog.
